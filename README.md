# React Projects Practise

Created this static site to learn React and Javascript.

You'll find a few projects in the top left by clicking on the tabs.

The projects aren't perfect, they're more proof of concepts.

Check them out here: https://xavierpurcell.github.io/ReactProjects/

I'll randomly do updates sometimes to fix mistakes!
